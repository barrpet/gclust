# TODO

- Settle on data types and use everywhere
- Accept either igraph objects or edgelists
- Doubles or floats, ints or longs
- Use ANSI adjacency array instead of C++11 adjacency list
- Fails for WIN32
- Merge subsets and full functions
- Remove all C++11 and use ANSI only (to compile with old gcc versions)
- Make use of OpenMP where applicable
- Be able to return igraph "communities" rather than just hclust
- Import or Depend on igraph, stats
- Clean up documentation
- Improve argument validation
- Import more sample networks
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
